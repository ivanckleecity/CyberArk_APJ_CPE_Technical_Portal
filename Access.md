## 1.4 Windows and MacOS Authenticator
- The CyberArk Authenticator is software installed on a Windows or macOS machine that generates TOTPs that you can use to satisfy authentication challenges when you sign in to CyberArk Identity. It's similar to mobile-based authenticators (for example, the CyberArk Idaptive mobile app or Google Authenticator), except that it can run on your Windows or macOS based machine. This allows you to use OTPs to sign in to CyberArk Identity without depending on a mobile device.

## 3.1 Secure Native Access
- Remote users and vendors can initiate privileged sessions directly from their desktop or mobile device with connection managers and RDP client applications, while benefiting from remote, VPN-less, password-less access. This enables remote vendor and IT administrators to use remote connection applications of their choice and maintain their regular work processes when working with PAM. The ability to connect is based on PAS account management, configuration, and access flows.
